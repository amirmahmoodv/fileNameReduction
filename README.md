# fileNameReduction
Imagine you have a nested document library with lots of folder and inner folders. There are some limitations on the length of the total path including filenames. This script will crawl through all the folder and subfolders and rename the filenames and reduce the characters which exceed the set limit. All the changelog including new path and old path will be saved in a excel file which will be saved in the root of the document library
